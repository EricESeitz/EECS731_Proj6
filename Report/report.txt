EECS 731 Project 6
D(St)reams of Anomalies
Goal: "Build one or more anomaly detection models to determine the  anomalies  using the other columns as features"

Data from:

3.  Load the  one  of the data set into panda data frames

My first inclination is to look into the "artificialWithAnomaly" dataset as this seems like the simplest place to start with anomoly detection.
Clean, precise data may not be realistic but first starting out I'd like the limit the amount of variables that may futz with my implementation.

The artificialWithAnomaly dataset seems to have a few different .csv files, according to the README.md located within the Data subfolder
"Artifically-generated data with varying types of anomalies."
Pretty straight forward. I'll be choosing one of these .csv files more or less at random, "art_daily_jumpsup.csv" seems as good as any place to start.
Loading it into Pandas I see the dataset isn't very large nor does it have many 'features'. 
It simply as two columns, 'timestamp' and 'value' with 4031 rows. Will this be an issue later? This is something I'll be keeping in mind as I go forward.

4.  Formulate one or two ideas on how feature engineering would help the data set to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
